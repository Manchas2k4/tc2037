# TC3027 - Implementation of Computational Methods

This intermediate computer technologies course focuses on competency development in the area of computer science. The main topics studied in this educational unit are: programming paradigms and automata theory. Prior knowledge is required of discrete mathematics and algorithm and data structure analysis, design and programming using a high-level language.

Learning outcome: Students design and implement programs that resolve diverse computer problems optimally through the application of the concepts of automata theory and using different programming paradigms.
